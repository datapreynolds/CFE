```

```{r config}
train_fp <- ""		#The filepath of the training data
```

```{r data import}
train <- read_csv(train_fp)
```

Note: Many of the numeric variables will not be parsed as numeric due to the way that the data is formatted in the .csv file (ie 100,000 is written as 1.00E+5). Need to determine whether to treat these as null or fix the import routine to include them.

```{r monthly loan approval rate}
monthly_data <- train %>%
	mutate(AppReceiveMonth = floor_date(as.Date(AppReceiveDate, format = '%m/%d/%Y'), unit = 'month')) %>%
	group_by(AppReceiveMonth) %>%
	summarize(ApprovalRate = mean(LoanStatus == 'Approved'))

ggplot(monthly_data, mapping = aes(AppReceiveMonth, ApprovalRate)) +
	geom_line() +
	coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,1), expand = FALSE)
```
