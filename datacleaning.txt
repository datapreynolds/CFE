VehicleMake - Dirty data, brands vary in capitalization, some misspellings, etc. Only hard question here is what to do about the trucks

CHEV, CHEVY -> CHEVROLET
DODGE TRUC, DODGE TRUCKS -> DODGE TRUCK
HARLEY, HARLEY DAVIDSON -> HARLEY-DAVIDSON
MERCEDES -> MERCEDES-BENZ
RAM TRUCKS -> RAM TRUCK

VehicleYear - For undecided vehicles, most Vehicle Year values are 0, one is 15 and one is 20 for some reason (both of these are from 2016. THE MATTER OF THE 0 VALUES IS A REAL PUZZLER, WE MAY NEED TO USE ADVANCED METHODS TO HALLUCINATE THE "CORRECT" VEHICLEYEAR IN THOSE CASES
